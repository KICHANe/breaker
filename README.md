# Breaker Engine
A 3D Game Engine for Open Use.

See Docs/main.md for Instalation Help and getting started.

## Background
I have many great game ideas, but am too much of a nerd to use a Prebuilt Engine that is Closed Source or requires Payments.
The Goal was 
- a Light Engine Executable that Only needs One Engine Runtime to play every game made in it. 
- a System that is Efficient in Memory and Resources.
- a Total Instalation size so minimal that anyone can use it.
- a Player and Developer base all United with one Open-Source Project.
